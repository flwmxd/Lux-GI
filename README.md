# ðŸ’¡ Lux-GI

**Hybrid GI solution, based on DDGI ( include  Ray-Tracing and SDF-Tracing )**

The project is a Hybrid GI solution, partly inspired by Lumen and DDGI. The main core idea is to provide a complete GI solution (including Indirect-Light, Infinite-Bounce, Emissive-Lighting, Glossy-Reflection, Shadow, AO) that can run on both Raytracing-supported and non-raytracing hardware. Due to the shortage of time, there are still some performance issues in this project, but as a throwaway, I believe it can provide some new ideas to most of the people who are interested in GI.
